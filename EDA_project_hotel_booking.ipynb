Which hotel has reasonable/ fair rate. For wich hotel there may be more cancellation observed after booking. What is the successful booking accommodation rate. From where people visit most frequent time.\n",

What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings."
